# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) service provided by GitHub. It helps automate software workflows and allows you to run a series of commands (actions) in response to specific triggers like pushing code to a repository, creating new releases, or even making comments on a pull request. These actions are defined in YAML files within a repository.

GitHub Actions is highly customizable and extensible. It provides a marketplace where developers can share and reuse actions created by the community, making it a versatile tool for many development tasks.

For Ruby on Rails developers, GitHub Actions can be particularly useful. They can set up workflows to automate their development process. Here are a few ways how they might use it:

1. **Running Tests:** They can configure GitHub Actions to automatically run their test suite whenever code is pushed to the repository. This helps catch issues early and ensures code quality.

2. **Linting and Code Analysis:** Actions can be used to automatically run code linters and analyzers, which help enforce coding standards and find potential issues.

3. **Deployment:** Rails developers can set up actions to automatically deploy their application to various environments (like staging, QA, or production) when certain conditions are met. This automates the deployment process and ensures it's consistently done the same way every time.

4. **Building Docker Images:** If the Rails application is containerized with Docker, actions can be used to automatically build and push Docker images to a registry whenever the application's code or its Dockerfile is updated.

5. **Database Migrations:** Rails developers can also automate database migrations through GitHub Actions. This ensures that the database schema is always in sync with the application's code.

In conclusion, GitHub Actions is a robust tool that can handle a wide array of tasks, helping Rails developers to automate their workflows, maintain code quality, and streamline their deployment processes.

## Setup for general Github Actions pipeline

To set up a basic GitHub Actions pipeline on a Ruby on Rails application, you need to create a YAML configuration file that defines your workflow. Below are instructions for setting up a simple workflow that will run your Rails test suite whenever code is pushed to your repository.

1. **Create Workflow File:**
   
   In your GitHub repository, create a new file in the `.github/workflows` directory. You can name it something like `test.yml`.

2. **Define Workflow:**
   
   In `test.yml`, start by defining the name of your workflow and when it should run. In this case, it will run on every `push` event.

   ```yaml
   name: Rails Test Suite
   on: [push]
   ```

3. **Define Jobs:**

   Next, define the jobs to run. You can run multiple jobs in a workflow. In this case, we will define a single job that runs your test suite. Each job runs on a runner, which is a server hosted by GitHub that has a specific operating system.

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
   ```

4. **Define Steps:**

   Define the steps for your job. Each step in a job executes a single command or action. You will typically start by checking out your code and setting up Ruby.

   ```yaml
   steps:
   - name: Checkout code
     uses: actions/checkout@v2

   - name: Set up Ruby
     uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
     with:
       ruby-version: 3.0.2
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**

   After setting up Ruby, you will need to install your application's dependencies.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: bundle install
   ```

6. **Setup Database:**

   If your application uses a database, you'll need to set it up. Here's an example using PostgreSQL:

   ```yaml
   - name: Setup test database
     env:
       RAILS_ENV: test
       PGHOST: localhost
       PGUSER: postgres
     run: |
       sudo apt-get -yqq install libpq-dev
       gem install pg
       bundle exec rake db:create
       bundle exec rake db:schema:load
   ```

7. **Run Tests:**

   Finally, run your tests:

   ```yaml
   - name: Run tests
     env:
       RAILS_ENV: test
     run: bundle exec rails test
   ```

So, the complete `test.yml` file should look like:

```yaml
name: Rails Test Suite
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Ruby
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: 3.0.2

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: bundle install

    - name: Setup test database
      env:
        RAILS_ENV: test
        PGHOST: localhost
        PGUSER: postgres
      run: |
        sudo apt-get -yqq install libpq-dev
        gem install pg
        bundle exec rake db:create
        bundle exec rake db:schema:load

    - name: Run tests
      env:
        RAILS_ENV: test
      run: bundle exec rails test
```

Once you've created this file, commit and push it to your repository. GitHub will automatically start running your new workflow on every push event.

Please note that you might need to adjust these instructions based on your project's specifics, such as a different database, additional environment variables, or the usage of a different testing framework.
