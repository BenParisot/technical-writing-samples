# AI is Just Another Development Tool

My take on this is pretty straightforward: at least for now, AI is a powerful tool that boosts productivity for developers in many ways. It helps with documentation, debugging, getting familiar with the syntax of a new language, contextualizing code, creating diagrams, and more.

Some people in the industry (or adjacent to it) fear that AI will take jobs. Here’s the reality: it probably will. However, the jobs it takes will be those that don't adapt to using AI. If a small dev team needs to be highly efficient and productive, they’re going to hire someone who knows how to use AI tools to speed up their workflow. The jobs that will disappear are those already leaning into automation or held by people who don’t know how to incorporate AI into their roles.

Scott Galloway has a great line on this doomsday thinking: "AI isn’t going to replace all knowledge workers; it’s going to replace people who don’t know how to use AI to do their jobs."

So, how do you survive the impending AI job shift? Here are my ideas, and things I’m working on myself:

1. Embrace the technology
Learn how to use these tools effectively. Understand how they’re built, and even try building some yourself! As AI tools advance and more companies adopt them, there will be a growing need for people who can manage and implement them.

2. Focus on relationships and communication skills
Take time to develop soft skills like communication and people management. Learn how to facilitate meetings or handle conflicts. These skills will be invaluable as more technical tasks become automated.

3. Work for an AI company
If you can’t beat them, join them, right? Instead of worrying about jobs lost to AI, why not work for a company that’s creating these tools? AI companies are growing fast, so it’s a great time to get involved.

4. Consider pivoting out of the knowledge industry
This one’s tough, especially if you’ve just graduated or completed specialized training. But many industries are facing labor shortages right now, so if you’re thinking about making a change, it might be worth researching which industries need workers and seeing if there’s something you’d enjoy.

In Conclusion: Don’t Fear the AI Boom
Learn the tools, embrace the technology, and take proactive steps to protect your career from the challenges AI may bring. With the right approach, you can not only secure your place in the industry but thrive as it evolves.
