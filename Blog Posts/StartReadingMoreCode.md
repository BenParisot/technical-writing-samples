# Why Reading Code is an Essential (and Often Overlooked) Skill for Developers

Reading code is a crucial part of development, but it’s often overlooked, especially by early-career developers. Most devs tend to focus on building things — which is important — but they don’t always spend enough time learning how to read and understand other people’s code. The ability to read code you didn’t write can really help you:

- Onboard to new projects more easily
- Debug more effectively
- Gain a better understanding of how an app works
- Build on top of an existing codebase
- Discover new ways of thinking or writing code you hadn’t considered before

## How to Improve Your Code-Reading Skills
If you’re not already on a dev team:
- **Onboard and contribute to open source projects:** This is a great way to practice reading unfamiliar code.
- **Look up public repos:** Pick an important function from an app, then work through it file by file and line by line, rewriting it in plain English. This helps you break down complex logic and understand what’s really going on.

If you’re already on a dev team:
- **Request to be a reviewer on PRs:** Make sure your approval doesn’t block anyone, but this is a great way to get practice reading code written by your teammates.
- Ask for reverse code review sessions: Offer to review someone else’s work and explain back to them what they wrote and why. This not only helps you understand the code but also strengthens your communication skills.
- Practice strict style pair programming: This helps you stay in sync with your team’s coding style and gets you used to reading and writing in a shared codebase.

It’s highly unlikely that you’ll ever work at a company where you’re building something entirely from scratch. You’ll always need to onboard to existing projects, and even if you do start fresh, eventually you’ll need to review other people’s work. As the application grows and the company scales, you’ll become less familiar with all parts of the codebase. That’s why it’s so important to get in the habit of reading and understanding other people’s code now.
